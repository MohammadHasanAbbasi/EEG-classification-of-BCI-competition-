# EEG-classification-of-BCI-competition-


Final project of machine Learning course.

EEG signals classification using LSTM,GRU and Biderectional LSTM

for dataset just use npz files of this [repository](https://github.com/bregydoc/bcidatasetIV2a) and put them in a folder named `dataset`

for running the code:
you should install jupyter notebook and write `jupyter notebook ` in command line.then select and run `main.ipynb`

you can change and debug and create your own models in seperated `.py` files and import them in `main.ipynb`
